PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
Geospatial Data Scientist & PhD researcher (Delhi School of Economics) specializing in GIS (9+ years), Remote
Sensing and AI/ML for multi-hazard modelling, DEM enhancement, and climate/disaster risk analytics. Built deep-
learning and ensemble pipelines that achieved up to 95.3% ROC-AUC for drought zonation; designed dual-stage DEM
void-repair + super-resolution (CRPAG→DS-HAT) for Himalayan terrain; and delivered end-to-end, reproducible
Python/GeoAI workflows for rainfall, flood, and land-surface analysis. Trusted to translate complex geospatial data
into actionable insights for planners and policy teams.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Senior Research Fellow (SRF) — Dept. of Geography, Delhi School of Economics, University of Delhi | Jan 2022–
Present
Leading PhD on multi-hazard assessment (Joshimath, Uttarakhand) using advanced RS/GIS + deep learning
+ MLOps + Data architecture.
Landslide susceptibility (DenseNet-169): 18 preconditioning factors; AUC-ROC validation with novel
GCP-based field checks; DenseNet outperformed MLP-NN & XGBoost (87% vs 85%/84%).
DEM enhancement (CRPAG→DS-HAT): Dual-stage, multi-modal pipeline fusing Sentinel-2 texture with
topography; improved RMSE (P95 ≈ 9.2 m) and SSIM vs baselines over high-relief terrain. Novel Algorithm
generation and detailed workflow/pipeline provided. Github+1 Github+2
Risk analytics: Applied SAM to auto-detect buildings near landslide hazard zones to prioritize mitigation.
